### Reflections and Comments
* This was a very fun lab to do, I hope all the next labs will be the same or better!
* I learned a bunch of new stuff:
    * How to add a link to an image
    * How to add a video
    * How to modify a list
* Figuering out CSS commands was the hardest part :sweat_smile:
